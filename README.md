# California's Most Wanted Yahoo Fantasy Site

Website to display weekly data for my Yahoo Fantasy Football League. In order to help keep league mates engaged in the league througout the season, I initially started a weekly newsletter with various data points about the league as a whole.
I figured I could take this a step further and build out a website that displays the data I had in my newsletters. The site would have past and present data readily available, instead of having the data being sent out in a weekly document.

**Data:**

- Top Scoring NFL Players with their managers by week
- Transactions by week
- Power rankings by week
- Team Rosters
- Past and present newsletters
- Previous league winners

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma

- HTML, CSS, and Javascript are used on the frontend to render various data points
- PostgreSQL used to store Yahoo Fantasy Data for the site
- Prisma ORM is used to get data from the database
- Express is used to route API calls so the front end can get the data it needs to render
